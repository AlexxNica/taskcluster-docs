Welcome

Welcome to TaskCluster!

TaskCluster is built as a collection of interrelated components and conventions.
It is intended to quietly get its work done with a minimum of fuss.
This is great, but makes it a bit hard to find your way!

To the right you'll find a collection of tutorials and presentations about TaskCluster.
Depending on your interest in the system, you may find some of these resources more useful than the others.
You can also consider browsing the documentation for each component, in the other sections of this site.
