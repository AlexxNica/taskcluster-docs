Interactive TaskCluster Tutorials
=================================

The goal of these interactive TaskCluster tutorials is to show you how to
utilize TaskCluster with modern asynchronous Javascript patterns. This page will
give a brief introduction to modern asynchronous Javascript patterns, and the rest
of the tutorials are focused on how to use TaskCluster.

The first tutorial [Authentication](../authenticate/) **must** be completed
before you proceed to the other tutorials, or the examples will not
work. The first few tutorials aim to give you a quick introduction and it's
recommended that you complete them.  However, before you get started you should
have a basic understanding of promises and `async` functions, this page should
provide the required background if you don't have it already. There are also 
other articles and sites dedicated to these language features.

Later tutorials will go into more depth focusing on how to combine
TaskCluster features and components to achieve high-level goals.
TaskCluster consists of many loosely coupled components, and while they all
have extensive reference-style documentation, it can be very hard to see how
all the pieces fit together.

To keep all of this exciting, the tutorials are designed to run in your browser.
The skills you learn here can be employed on both servers and static web-sites 
using TaskCluster APIs to display state, listen for events, spawn tasks and many 
other things.

Note: the graphical TaskCluster tools on `tools.taskcluster.net` are all
written in client-side Javascript. In fact, the entire site is a static
web-site hosted on a CDN.
