TaskCluster - Mozilla Testing Infrastructure
============================================

**TaskCluster is** a set of components that manages task queuing, scheduling,
execution and provisioning of resources. It was designed to run automated builds
and test at Mozilla.





### TaskCluster Scope
<blockquote>
  TaskCluster promises a <b>consistent task execution</b> environment.
</blockquote>

**This means**, that if you submit the same _deterministic task_ twice then
you should get two consistent resolutions.
