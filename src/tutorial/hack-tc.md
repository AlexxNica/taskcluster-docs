# Hacking on TaskCluster

Hacking on TaskCluster is really easy. Head over to the [TaskCluster GitHub
page](https://github.com/taskcluster) and dive right in. Fork a project you
want to contribute to and feel free to make pull requests.

The code base uses ES6 syntax and features like promises and async.
[This page](async-javascript) should provide the required background if you
donâ€™t have it already.
